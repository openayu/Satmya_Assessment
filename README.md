## ASSESSMENT OF SATMYA (ADAPTABILITY) IN HEALTHY/DISEASED INDIVIDUALS
Outcome

### Improvement of clinical skill in BAMS students.

### Significance

The satmya (adaptability) is a very important factor which should be examined in both healthy and diseased individuals.
The history of satmya is often overlooked by physicians and sometimes not even disclosed by patients. It forms the backbone of treatment as the treatment is selected based on dosha prakopa, prakriti, ritu (season), or desh (habitat).
Medicines possessing opposite qualities or beneficial in other ways are given to the patient based on their condition. In healthy individuals too, consideration of these factors is important.
In the present times, allergic disorders are quite common. These are usually seen with changes in season, habitat, or food habit. Knowledge of drug allergy, food allergy, and seasonal allergy is vital in diagnosis, treatment planning, and advising pathya-apathya.

### Utility of Assessment of Satmya

Estimation of tendency to fall sick in the condition of changes in weather and/or habitat, dietary changes, or allergies to some foods.
Appropriate selection of medicine as per suitability.
Proper planning of pathya-apathya (diet).
Adoption of precautionary measures in case of climatic, habitat, or dietary changes.

### Background of Satmaya / Adaptability

Satmaya refers to food or habits that are beneficial or advantageous for a person. It signifies the adaptability of individuals to foods and habits that they have been using continuously and over a long period of time without experiencing any harmful effect.
The factors considered for satmya include ritu (season), desh (habitat), prakriti (physical constitution or temperament), food material, and roga (disease).
In addition to these, there is a factor known as okasatmtya, which is the adaptability of someone to something generally non-beneficial but becomes suitable and non-harmful for that person when they become accustomed to it.
Adaptability for different things varies from person to person.

### Categorization of Patients as Per Satmya

Pravara Satmaya / Sarvarasasatmya (High adaptability): Individuals who regularly consume ghrita, oil, milk, meat soups and all six rasa in their food are strong, able to tolerate pain, and have longer lifespans. They have the strength, resilience, and longevity to adapt to climatic changes, habitat changes, and dietary changes.
Madhyamasatmaya (Medium adaptability): Those with mixed food habits and three or four rasa in their diets have average strength and lifespans. They can sometimes adapt to climatic changes, habitat changes, and dietary changes, but not always.
Avara Satmaya / Ekarasasatmya (Low adaptability): Individuals who habitually consume dry foods (ruksha ahara) and one or two types of rasa are weak, unable to tolerate pain, and have shorter lifespans. They struggle to adapt to climatic changes, habitat changes, and dietary changes.
